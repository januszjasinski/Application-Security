# Static Analysis

Dynamic analysis is the testing and evaluation of an application during runtime. Static analysis is the testing and evaluation of an application by examining the code without executing the application.

- [GuardRails](https://www.guardrails.io) - Continuous verification platform that integrates tightly with leading version control systems.
- [Security Code Scan](https://github.com/security-code-scan/security-code-scan) - Vulnerability Patterns Detector for C# and VB.NET.
- [Puma Scan](https://github.com/pumasecurity/puma-scan) - Puma Scan is a .NET software secure code analysis tool providing real time, continuous source code analysis.
- [DevSkim](https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim) - DevSkim is a set of IDE plugins and rules that provide security "linting" capabilities.
- [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet) - SonarC# and SonarVB are static code analyser for C# and VB.â€‹NET languages used as an extension for the SonarQube and SonarCloud platforms.
